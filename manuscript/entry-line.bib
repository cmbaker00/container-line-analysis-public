Hepworth and Biggerstaff (JABES, 22:602–614, 2017) proposed an estimator based on the bias correction method of Firth (Biometrika 80:27–38, 1993) and showed that it is almost unbiased across a range of pooled testing problems involving no misclassification. We now extend their work to allow for imperfect testing. We derive the estimator, provide a Newton–Raphson iterative formula for its computation and test it in situations involving equal or unequal pool sizes, drawing on problems encountered in plant disease assessment and prevalence estimation of mosquito-borne viruses. Our estimator is highly effective at reducing the bias for prevalences consistent with the pooled testing procedure employed.},

	abstract = {In the estimation of proportions by pooled testing, the MLE is biased, and several methods of correcting the bias have been presented in previous studies. We propose a new estimator based on the bias correction method introduced by Firth (Biometrika 80:27–38, 1993), which uses a modification of the score function, and we provide an easily computable, Newton–Raphson iterative formula for its computation. Our proposed estimator is almost unbiased across a range of problems, and superior to existing methods. We show that for equal pool sizes the new estimator is equivalent to the estimator proposed by Burrows (Phytopathology 77:363–365, 1987). The performance of our estimator is examined using pooled testing problems encountered in plant disease assessment and prevalence estimation of mosquito-borne viruses.},

	abstract = {Group testing involves pooling individual specimens (e.g., blood, urine, swabs, etc.) and testing the pools for the presence of a disease. When individual covariate information is available (e.g., age, gender, number of sexual partners, etc.), a common goal is to relate an individual's true disease status to the covariates in a regression model. Estimating this relationship is a nonstandard problem in group testing because true individual statuses are not observed and all testing responses (on pools and on individuals) are subject to misclassification arising from assay error. Previous regression methods for group testing data can be inefficient because they are restricted to using only initial pool responses and/or they make potentially unrealistic assumptions regarding the assay accuracy probabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a general Bayesian regression framework for modeling group testing data. The novelty of our approach is that it can be easily implemented with data from any group testing protocol. Furthermore, our approach will simultaneously estimate assay accuracy probabilities (along with the covariate effects) and can even be applied in screening situations where multiple assays are used. We apply our methods to group testing data collected in Iowa as part of statewide screening efforts for chlamydia, and we make user-friendly R code available to practitioners.},

Group testing can be used to reduce costs of assay and upper confidence limits for the proportion of detrimental individuals can be used for either estimation or hypothesis testing. A crucial problem of group testing is the appropriate choice of group size in dependence of the number of groups, an assumed true proportion, and the threshold. This paper reports on experimental design to achieve high power for tests or low confidence interval width. Two agricultural applications are presented for which experimental design is discussed.},

	abstract = {Summary. In the assessment of disease, estimation of the proportion of infected units in a population can sometimes be facilitated by pooling units into groups for testing. Such group testing was used in a study of virus infection levels in carnation plants grown in glasshouses. In group testing problems, the maximum likelihood estimator is a biased estimator of the population proportion. We investigate the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator when testing groups of different size, using fixed and sequential procedures. The possibility of obtaining all positive groups contributes substantially to the bias. Analytical methods are shown to correct the bias for fixed procedures satisfactorily. For sequential procedures, with their uneven bias patterns, we propose a numerical method of correction which produces an almost unbiased estimator.},

	abstract = {Group testing methods are used widely to assess the presence of a contaminant, based on measurements of the concentration of a biomarker, for example to test the presence of a disease in pooled blood samples. The test would be perfect if it produced a positive result whenever the contaminant was present, and a negative result otherwise. However, in practice the test is always at least somewhat imperfect, for example because it is sensitive to the proportion of contaminated items in the group, rather than to the sheer existence of one or more contaminated items. We develop a nonparametric method for accommodating this dilution effect. Our approach allows us to estimate, under minimal assumptions, the probability \$m(x)\$ that an item is contaminated, conditional on the value \$x\$ of an explanatory variable, and to estimate the probability, \$q\$, that an individual chosen at random is disease free, and the specificity Sp, and the sensitivity Se, of the test. These are all ill-posed problems, where poor convergence rates are usually encountered, but despite this, our estimators of \$q\$, Sp and Se are root-\$N\$ consistent, where \$N\$ denotes the total number of individuals in all the groups, and our estimator of \$m(x)\$ converges at the rate it would enjoy if \$q\$, Sp and Se were known.},

	abstract = {Group testing has been widely used in epidemiology and related fields to estimate prevalence of rare diseases. Parametric binary regression models are used in group testing to estimate the covariate adjusted prevalence. Unlike the standard binary regression model (viz., logistic, complementary log–log, etc.), the regression model for group testing data connects the maximum of a group of independent binary responses to its covariate values. Recently, in group testing literature, it has been extensively used for estimating covariate adjusted prevalence of a disease making the tacit assumptions that (i) the regression model is identifiable, and (ii) the standard asymptotic theory is valid for the maximum likelihood estimators of the regression parameters. Verifying these assumptions is found to be non-trivial theoretical issues. In this paper, we give theoretical proofs of these assumptions under a set of simple sufficient conditions, thus, providing a theoretical justification for likelihood based inference on the regression parameters. We also provide an outline of the proof extending the asymptotic theory to the data obtained by Dorfman retesting, where all subjects in a positive group are retested.},

	abstract = {In screening applications involving low-prevalence diseases, pooling specimens (e.g., urine, blood, swabs, etc.) through group testing can be far more cost effective than testing specimens individually. Estimation is a common goal in such applications and typically involves modeling the probability of disease as a function of available covariates. In recent years, several authors have developed regression methods to accommodate the complex structure of group testing data but often under the assumption that covariate effects are linear. Although linearity is a reasonable assumption in some applications, it can lead to model misspecification and biased inference in others. To offer a more flexible framework, we propose a Bayesian generalized additive regression approach to model the individual-level probability of disease with potentially misclassified group testing data. Our approach can be used to analyze data arising from any group testing protocol with the goal of estimating multiple unknown smooth functions of covariates, standard linear effects for other covariates, and assay classification accuracy probabilities. We illustrate the methods in this article using group testing data on chlamydia infection in Iowa.},
